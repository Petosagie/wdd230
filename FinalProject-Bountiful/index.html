            Karlsbad Hanse House on Carlsbad Boulevard, a famous landmark that is the site of the first
            mineral water spa in the village dating back to the 1880s, and a good place to indulge in a
            mineral spa treatment or massage.<br> <br>

            Stroll through the Carlsbad Village Farmer’s Market held on Wednesdays and pick some fresh
            local fruits and vegetables or enjoy a drink at one of several buzzing bars and hot night spots
