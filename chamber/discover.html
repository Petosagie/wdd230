                <hr><br><b>About Benin City</b><br>
                <br>Benin City, also called Edo, is the capital and largest city of Edo state, southern Nigeria. Benin
                City is situated on a branch of the
                Benin River and lies along the main highways from Lagos to the eastern states. The city is also linked
                by roads to Sapele, Siluko, Okene,
                and Ubiaja and is served by air and the Niger River delta ports of Koko and Sapele. It is the
                fourth-largest city in Nigeria according to the 2006 census, after Lagos, Kano, and Ibadan, with a
                population estimate of 1,841,000 as of 2022.<br>

                <br>Benin City was the principal city of the Edo (Bini) kingdom of Benin (flourished 13th–19th century).
                It was destroyed in 1897 by the British, who attacked after the Edo assaulted an earlier British
                expedition, which had been told not to
                enter the city during a religious festival but nonetheless attempted to do so. Before burning the city
                down, the British pillaged it, taking many of its famous bronzes, ivory, and other treasures. Traces of
                the old wall and moat remain, but
                the new city is a close-packed pattern of houses and streets converging on the palace and compound of
                the oba (sacred king) and the government offices. In the main square is a statue of Emotan, a woman
                honoured for assisting a 15th-century
                prince attempting to regain power and who later became Oba Ewuare. The present oba retains traditional
                and advisory roles in government.<br>

                <br>Benin City has long been famous for its “bronzes”—actually brass work, some of which is said to date
                from the 13th century—and for its ivory and wood carvings. Its museum (1960) has a notable collection of
                some of the kingdom’s early pieces.
                The city’s present artisans still practice the ancient method of cire perdue (“lost-wax”) casting, and
                its wood-carvers are organized into a cooperative craft society.

                <hr>

                <br><b>History of Edo people</b><br>
                Edo people, according to tradition, the original people and founders of the Ẹdo Empire and the Ẹdo
                people initially were ruled by Oranmiya
                dynasty who called their land Igodomigodo. Igodo, the first Ogiso, wielded much influence and gained
                popularity as a good ruler.
                He died after a long reign and was succeeded by Ere, his eldest son. A battle for power soon erupted
                between the wife of the last Ogiso
                and prince Ekaladerhan from Ife, son of the last Ogiso. Prince Ekaladerhan was framed by his father's
                wife and sentenced to death.
                The men sent to kill him, however, released him at Ughoton. The exiled prince made his way to where he
                changed his name to Izoduwa,
                meaning "I have found prosperity". It was during this period of confusion in Benin that the elders, led
                by Chief Oliha, mounted a search
                for the banished Prince Ekaladerhan – whom the Ife people now called Oduduwa.<br><br>
                <hr>

                also the home of one of the oldest sustained monarchies in
                the world. Various festivals are held in Benin City yearly to celebrate various historic occasions and
                seasons. Igue festival is the most popular of the festivals
                where the Oba celebrates the history and culture of his people and blesses the land and the people. It
                is celebrated at a time between Christmas and New Year.

                <b>Where is Benin City</b><br>
                Benin City is in Edo State, Southern part of Nigeria. It is situated on a branch of the Benin River and
                lies along the main highways from Lagos to the

                <br><br>
                <b>Historical background</b><br>

                Edo people, according to tradition, the original people and founders of the Ẹdo Empire and the Ẹdo
                people initially were ruled by Oranmiya dynasty who called their land Igodomigodo. Igodo, the first
                Ogiso, wielded
                much influence and gained popularity as a good ruler. He died after a long reign and was succeeded by
                Ere, his eldest son.
                A battle for power soon erupted between the wife of the last Ogiso and prince Ekaladerhan from Ife, son
                of the last Ogiso.
                Prince Ekaladerhan was framed by his father's wife and sentenced to death. The men sent to kill him,
                however, released him at
                Ughoton. The exiled prince made his way to where he changed his name to Izoduwa, meaning "I have found
                prosperity".
                It was during this period of confusion in Benin that the elders, led by Chief Oliha, mounted a search
                for the banished
                Prince Ekaladerhan – whom the Ife people now called Oduduwa.<br>


                <br>The exiled Ekaladerhan, now Oduduwa, refused to come to Benin because of how he was treated, having
                found out that he wasn't
                killed. He divised to send one of his sons, Oramiyan. He refused to return from Ile-Ife but sent his son
                Ọranmiyan to become
                king in his place. Prince Ọranmiyan took up residence in the palace built for him at Uzama by the
                elders, now a coronation
                shrine. Soon after he married a beautiful lady, Ẹrinmwide, daughter of Osa-nego, the ninth Enogie of
                Egor. He and Erinmwide
                had a son. After some years he called a meeting of the people and renounced his office, remarking that
                the country was a
                land of vexation, Ile-Ibinu, and that only a child born, trained and educated in the arts and mysteries
                of the land could
                reign over the people. The country was afterward known by this name. He caused his son born to him by
                Ẹrinmwide to be made
                King in his place and returned to Benin land. After some years in Ife, he left for Benin, where he also
                left a son behind
                upon leaving, and his son Ajaka ultimately became the first Oba of Benin of the present line, while
                Ọranmiyan himself was
                reigning as Ọọni of Ifẹ. Therefore, Ọranmiyan of Ife, the father of Ẹwẹka I, the Ọba of Benin, was also
                the father of Ajaka,
                Alaafin of Ọyọ.[ Ọọni of Ifẹ. Allegedly Ọba Ẹwẹka later changed the name of the city of Ile-Binu, the
                capital of the Benin
                kingdom, to "Ubinu." This name would be reinterpreted by the Portuguese as "Benin" in their own
                language. Around 1470, Ẹwuare
                changed the name of the state to Ẹdo. This was about the time the people of Ọkpẹkpẹ migrated from Benin
                City. Alternatively,
                the Yoruba nation has a different conception of Oduduwa.[ According to Yoruba tradition, because of his
                power and military
                might, he was able to defeat the enemies invading Benin and that is why the people of Benin made him the
                King or Ọba of
                Benin. In any case, it is agreed upon by both the Yoruba and the Edo that Oduduwa sent his son Prince
                Oranmiyan of Ife to
                rule Benin City and founded the Oba dynasty in Benin City.<br>

                <br>Benin imperialism was started in the last decade of the thirteen century by Oba Ewedo.<br>


                <br><b>Festival</b><br>

                Christmas and New Year celebrations.
                The festival includes the Oba's blessing of the land and his people.
